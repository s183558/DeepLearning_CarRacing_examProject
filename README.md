# Title:
    Reinforcement learning - DDPG CarRacing


# Description
    This folder contains a solution for the DDPG algorithm used on the Gym.ai CarRacing environment.
    In the source folder, the 4 different scripts for training the algorithm can be located.
    An IPython Notebook in this folder contains all of the scripts, which can be run on Google Colab

# Installation
    The scripts has been created in Python 3.9
    The following modules are required to run the simulation:

        - Gym         (version 0.25.2)
        - Numpy       (version 1.23.4)
	- Matplotlib  (verion 3.5.2)
        - wanb        (verion 0.13.5)
        - Torch       (verion 1.10.2) 

# How to use it
    Colab:
      Import the IPython notebook into Colab, and run it.
      
    .py terminal:
      Run the main.py script, which will begin training the algorithm.
